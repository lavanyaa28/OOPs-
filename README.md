# OOPs-
Personal notes and code for Java OOPs


// difference between abstraction and encapsulation
Key Differences:
**Encapsulation**
**Focus**	Hiding internal data (control access)	
**How**	Use of access modifiers (private, public)	
**Goal**	Protect the object	
**Exposure**	Exposes necessary methods to interact with data
**Real-world analogy**	A pill capsule hiding the powder


**Abstraction**
**Focus**	Hiding implementation complexity
**How** Use of abstract classes, interfaces
**Goal**	Simplify usage
**Exposure**	Exposes essential features, hides details
**Real-world analogy**		A car's steering system â€“ you don't see the mechanism
